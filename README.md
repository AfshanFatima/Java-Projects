#[Practice Java by Building Projects](https://www.udemy.com/practice-java-by-building-projects/)


**The BEST way to prepare for a technical interview is to get practice building applications and applying core principles of object-oriented design. This course is  designed to accomplish that objective.**


Many people fail interviews because:

They don't grasp object-oriented programming concepts

They can't apply object-oriented design in an actual program

They haven't practiced developing their applications by hand

They haven't debugged their code and overcome challenges

This course is designed for someone who simply wants to get better at understanding and applying Java design and object-oriented programming. It is perhaps the most effective thing you can do to prepare for your job interview. Forget about flashcards, forget about quizzes. Start practicing!

In this Practical Java course, you will build realistic projects from scratch. We will approach each program analytically and outline our approach to implement the solution. Then, piece by piece we will write the code to create a fully functioning application.

Understand client scenarios and requirements

Approach each problem analytically

Write our solution outline

Implement code step-by-step

Apply core principals of object-oriented design

Everyone hoping to start out in Java needs to practice! It's not enough to learn and watch, but you must try yourself! So enroll in this course and get typing!

Note: this course was build for someone who has some working knowledge and familiarity of Java or application design. If you are new to Java, I recommend enrolling in my "Become a Junior Java Software Developer" course first.

What youâ€™ll learn:

Implement core object-oriented programming techniques

Optimize applications with best practices and sharpen your programming skills

Master design principles and apply proper architecture to solve problems

Apply inheritance, interfaces, access modifiers, encapsulation, polymorphism

Use data structures and arrays to handle data sets and collection of objects

Develop your own utility class to read data and export results to a file

Analyze data from a file and apply conditional operations to make decisions

Design a real-world project with abstract classes and abstract methods

Use constructors, overloading, and overriding to enhance applications

Are there any course requirements or prerequisites?

Familiar with Java development environment

Knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts recommended

Consider enrolling in my "Become a Junior Java Software Developer" course

Who this course is for:

Current students or recent graduates

Anyone looking to practice Java

Someone preparing for a Java interview

Someone starting a new Java project

Anyone wanting a refresher on object-oriented programming or application architecture.# java projects
